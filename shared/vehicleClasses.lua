-- Vehicle classes for boosting
-- This is a placeholder file. In a production environment, you would map
-- specific vehicle models to their boosting classes here.

-- The actual vehicle classes will be determined by the QBX.Shared.Vehicles entries
-- where each vehicle has a 'class' property that dictates its boosting class.

-- Example entry in QBX.Shared.Vehicles:
-- ['adder'] = {
--     name = 'Adder',
--     brand = 'Truffade',
--     model = 'adder',
--     price = 1000000,
--     category = 'super',
--     class = 'S+',  -- This is the boosting class used for this resource
--     dealer = 'luxury'
-- },
